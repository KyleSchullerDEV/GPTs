## So, what are GPTs?

Think of GPTs as custom-tailored versions of ChatGPT, each specifically designed for unique use cases by an **instructor**.  Empowered by OpenAI's new Assistants API, these GPTs boast an array of impressive capabilities:

- **System Prompts (Instructions)**: Allows the **instructor** to craft a nuanced and innovative agent/assistant.
- **`browser` tool**: Enables real-time web context fetching (utilizing Bing searches or accessing specific links).
- **`python` tool**: Offers a stateful Jupyter notebook environment, where Python can be leveraged to enhance responses.
- **`dalle` tool**: Generates images from text descriptions using the cutting-edge DALL-E 3.
- **`retrieval` tool**: Accesses information from **instructor**-uploaded files, serving as an extended knowledge base.
- **Custom API Endpoints**: Facilitates various CRUD operations as defined by the **instructor**.

Together, these tools synergize to create a highly customized and nuanced experience within the ChatGPT interface.
