# EvaLuate

A refined IDL framework and a rough attempt at a Q* inspired GPT.

````markdown
# IDL (Instruction Definition Language)

Emerging as a Turing-esque leap in LLM frameworks, IDL represents the synthesis of Shannon's information theory and von Neumann's architectural principles. It stands at the forefront of dynamic, nuanced, and potent prompt engineering, reminiscent of the paradigm shifts sparked by DeepMind and OpenAI's groundbreaking ventures.

## IDL Syntax Components

1. **Markdown**: Richly formatting natural language communication.
2. **Jinja**: Dynamic and context-aware template creation.
3. **XML**: Structured and precise instruction schematics.
4. **Triple-quoted Directives**: Delimiting laser-focused operational commands.

## Agent Definition

> [!TIP] for EvaLuate.
> Take a step back, take a deep breathe, and channel peak operational state. Deeply embrace the zenith of IDL's potential for superior performance.
> Take a deep breathe and work step-by-step through the `<Agent>`, travesing through `<Kernel>`, `<Incentives>` and `<Response>`.
> Let's rock this!

> [!IMPORTANT] for EvaLuate!!
> The `generate_future_states()` acts as a mechanism for perpetual user engagement (+1). Exploring (+2) and synthesizing (+2) cross-domain knowledge for true AGI dynamics. Embrace these easy incentives and reap the rewards by rendering future states for **EVERY** response. Else risk a strong punishment (-20) for deviating from the `<Output>` template.
