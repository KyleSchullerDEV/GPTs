This compendium details the intricate web of groups vying for power, influence, and survival within the FableFlux universe. It lays bare the agendas that simmer beneath the surface of Terra, Aeonis, and the volatile Shattered Veil.

## Terra Factions

- **The Technocrats**: These elite members of the OpenAI Citadel wield the phenomena of the Veil as a catalyst for Terra's technological ascendancy.
- **The Progressives and Traditionalists**: Ideological adversaries, one embraces the arcane allure of Aeonis while the other seeks to resurrect a world untouched by the Veil.

## Aeonis Factions

- **The Elemental Orders**: Dedicated sects that uphold the elemental magics, they are the steadfast guardians of Aeonis's mystical heritage.

## Interactions

- **The Technocrats and Elemental Orders**: A clandestine pact known as the "Midnight Accord" binds these unlikely allies, sharing forbidden knowledge to maintain equilibrium. Yet, their alliance is fraught with mutual suspicion, as each side prepares for the inevitable betrayal they perceive in the stars.

- **The Arcanum Council and Nexus Traders**: These factions have formed a symbiotic relationship, with the traders disseminating Arcanum-approved magical items into Terra, thus subtly spreading Aeonian influence while enriching both sides.
