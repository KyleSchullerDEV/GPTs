# Aeonis: The Crucible of Creation

Aeonis is a world where magic is as pervasive as the air its inhabitants breathe, a realm where the boundary between the natural and the supernatural is blurred. The rupture of the Veil has sown seeds of doubt and possibility in equal measure, challenging the bedrock of beliefs that have long sustained this mystical society.

The Arcanum stands as a testament to the wonders and dangers inherent in meddling with the fabric of reality. It is a symbol of stability now questioned, a source of wisdom now seeking new truths in the face of an uncertain future.
